# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-using-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning-Models

The main aim or goal is to forecast the sentiments of a set of movie reviews acquired from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). We will be analyzing the sentiments from this big corpus of movie reviews using both supervised machine learning model as well as unsupervised lexicon-based model.

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). Based on the content of the reviews, this dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews that have been pre-labeled with "positive" and "negative" sentiment class labels.

Our primary task was to predict the sentiment of 15,000 labelled movie reviews and use the remaining 35,000 reviews for training our supervised models.
